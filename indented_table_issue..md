Here is an example of an *unindented* table:

A “Hollow” Candle Chart has four types of candles:
| Candle Type | Defining Data |
| --- | --- |
| Up Color Hollow | Close > Previous Close  and  Close > Open |
| Up Color Filled | Close > Previous Close  and  Close < Open |
| Down Color Hollow | Close < Previous Close  and  Close > Open |
| Down Color Filled | Close < Previous Close  and  Close < Open |

* And here is an example of an **indented** table, which works fine in GitHub markdown, *but not* in gmail via Markdown Here:

* A “Hollow” Candle Chart has four types of candles:
  | Candle Type | Defining Data |
  | --- | --- |
  | Up Color Hollow | Close > Previous Close  and  Close > Open |
  | Up Color Filled | Close > Previous Close  and  Close < Open |
  | Down Color Hollow | Close < Previous Close  and  Close > Open |
  | Down Color Filled | Close < Previous Close  and  Close < Open |
  
  - I can even indent tables at two levels like this:
    | Candle Type | Defining Data |
    | --- | --- |
    | Up Color Hollow | Close > Previous Close  and  Close > Open |
    | Up Color Filled | Close > Previous Close  and  Close < Open |
    | Down Color Hollow | Close < Previous Close  and  Close > Open |
    | Down Color Filled | Close < Previous Close  and  Close < Open |
    
That's all folks!
